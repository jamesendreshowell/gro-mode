* gro-mode
Emacs major mode for "freewriting" (after Elbow, 1973).

** Background
Peter Elbow (and others) have suggested a method of "freewriting," eschewing all reflection, revision, and editing. I could find no tool for this style of writing, so I wrote a very simple major mode that binds all the editing commands (that I thought of off the top of my head) to insert an asterisk.

** Usage
Just =(require 'gro)= in your emacs initialization file.

Files ending in =.gro= will start in =gro-mode=.
